## The problem, as I read it

Prosper's deployment team spends its time on two manual loops:

1. **Initial implementation.** A clinic hands over natural-language guidelines
   (how to greet, what to collect, when to escalate, which visits need what) and
   someone translates them into a working agent graph.
2. **Production iteration.** Clients flag issues, or issues hide in call data.
   Someone has to find them, work out which part of the agent caused them, change
   it, and make sure the fix does not break something else. Finding the issues is
   itself a large part of the cost.

The builder UI (Phase 1) is the surface; the Copilot (Phase 2) is the point. The
measure of success is how much of those two loops it takes off the team's hands.

## Scope

_What is built, what is mocked, and what is deliberately left out, with the
reason for each. Filled in as the build progresses._

## Architecture

_Overview diagram and the main components. Filled in as the build progresses._

## Key decisions

_One entry per decision: context, the options considered, the choice, and its
trade-offs._

## How this was built

- Built with AI coding agents (Claude). `AGENTS.md` gives every coding agent the same context:
  goal, invariants, conventions and git workflow.
- Every change lands through a PR with CI (ruff) and an automated Claude review
  whose instructions are versioned in `.github/workflows/claude-review.yml`.
- PRs merge with merge commits, so the history shows how the work progressed.
